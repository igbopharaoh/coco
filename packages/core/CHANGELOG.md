# coco-cashu-core

## 1.1.2-rc.49

### Patch Changes

- 5447e2c: Persist bolt11 melt `payment_preimage` data on finalized operations via method-specific
  `finalizedData`, store it across all melt operation repositories, and update adapter tests to
  require preimage propagation only when the mint actually returns one.
- 8a2d720: Finish the mint quote removal migration and make mint operations the runtime source of truth.

  - Replace legacy `mint-quote:*` runtime events with operation-based mint events.
  - Rename watcher and processor config and manager methods to the operation-based surface:
    `mintOperationWatcher`, `mintOperationProcessor`, `enableMintOperationWatcher()`,
    `enableMintOperationProcessor()`, and related disable/wait helpers.
  - Remove the legacy `MintQuoteService` runtime path and keep `MintQuoteRepository` only for
    cold-start reconciliation of old persisted quote rows.
  - Move mint watcher, processor, history, and recovery flows onto `manager.ops.mint`.

  This is a breaking change for consumers using the old mint watcher/processor config keys,
  manager methods, or `mint-quote:*` events.

## 1.1.2-rc.48

### Patch Changes

- db8f3c5: Add NUT-21/22 auth support (CAT/BAT lifecycle)
- 3b29203: fix: Made sure processPaymentRequest will return the decoded PR even if no mints have enough balance
- befcdcf: Fix keyset denomination handling so mint key maps are preserved with string keys instead of being
  coerced to `Number` before persistence. This avoids precision loss for large denomination keys, keeps
  split logic limited to safe integer values, and adds storage migrations that clear cached keysets so
  they are re-fetched in the corrected format.
- 16f3de1: Add changeAmount and effectiveFee to finalized melt operations for accurate settlement reporting, with adapter persistence and legacy compatibility for older melt records.
- c9e378c: Add `manager.ops` as the standard operation API for send, receive, and melt flows, including the follow-up docs and typing updates for the default `bolt11` melt path.
- 6b2ac82: Fix: added mint-level operation locking on proof selection to avoid race conditions in near-parallel execution

  > [!WARNING]
  > The lock is memory level and does not prevent race conditions in multi-process environments

## 1.1.2-rc.47

### Patch Changes

- 980cff1: feat: Added missing util method to QuotesApi (rollback, getPending/getPrepared)

## 1.1.2-rc.46

## 1.1.2-rc.45

### Patch Changes

## 1.1.2-rc.44

### Patch Changes

- 8bb6f67: Fix: Migrate from deprecated sqlite3 package to better-sqlite3

  Fix: Made sure bootstrap inflight check finalizes send operations when proofs are returned spent.

  WARNING: This is a breaking change for bun environments, as bun currently does not support the better-sqlite3 binding! Bun consumers should use the sqlite-bun adapter instead!!

## 1.1.2-rc.43

### Patch Changes

- 6f0ed09: feat: adds new methods to the WalletAPI:

  - `WalletApi.encode`: This method encodes a Token into a V4 cashuB token
  - `WalletApi.decode`: This method decodes a string token into its decoded Token form. It will use the internal keyset information to resolve short keyset IDs automatically

- ad87919: Feat: Add checkInflightProofs method and wired it up inside proofStateWatcher, so that inflight proofs are state-checked on startup and subscribed to if still inflight
- 2057978: Fix: Added missing startup recovery for MeltOperations
- db2baec: Feat: Add optional token field to ReceiveHistoryEntries
